# FreestyleNet
Official PyTorch implementation of [Freestyle Layout-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14412)

## Introduction

FreestyleNet is a diffusion-based network that can generate diverse semantics onto a given layout. Compared to prior layout-to-image synthesis methods and text-to-image generation models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), FreestyleNet is armed with more controllability, enabling 1) the generation of semantics beyond the pre-defined semantic categories in the training dataset, and 2) the separate modulation of each class in the layout with text.
